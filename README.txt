Project: Audio Drama Database (ADD) 
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: A website where users can track, record, and share their progress on various audio dramas. A user creates an account then is able to customize it, mark progress on titles, find and add other accounts, create lists, add favorites, and join chat communities. (similar in concept to Letterboxd, MyAnimeList, Goodreads, etc.)

Language: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Reason: Recently I have been trying to document what movies, books, and games I've been playing to talk with my friends about and keep as a record for myself. Another type of media I enjoy are audio dramas and I would love to be able to cultivate a space where people could track what they're listening to and see what their friends are listening to as well. Not only that, I'd love to meet other people who are into audio dramas, so if I could cultivate a space for that I'd be really happy. (A few favs are: Wolf359, Midnight Burger, and The Bright Sessions)

Plan: 
        1. Research other similarly structured sites and figure out features I want to include.
        2. Figure out what is within my means of creation and formulate a pseudo-model of the site.
        3. Research ways to properly create the user and user-interaction features I want.
        4. Find a way to properly host the site, so that other people can interact with it.
        5. Pitch idea to someone in the field and see if they believe it has merit.
        6. After yes, focus in on each component, and tackle them one by one, coding them in whatever language is applicable. 
                a. These components may include: login, sign-up, database, add to database (rate if wanted), search users, user pages, community forums, alerts/mail, edit entry, dedicated page (for VAs, series, producers, etc.), list of user created playlists, create playlist...
        7. Do any necessary debugging of the code.
        8. Add any extra visual "flair" or aesthetic aspects. (ask Bella? ask Jack?)
        9. Show the site to some test users and have them find any potential bugs/problems. 
        10. Make any additional fixes based off bugs that are discovered by those intial users.  
        11. Figure out a proper hosting system to have the site go up on. 
        12. Have the website go live. 
        13. Reach out people within the community and deal with any intial issues they bring up. 
        14. Manage the server and upgrade if it becomes necessary and I haev the means to. 

Optional:
        - create a social media page for the site (Instagram, X (?), etc.)
        - make promo posts / visuals to use when needed
        - write out an email to send to people within the field asking about including their audio drama and maybe having them mention the site
        - ADD as the potnetial name since most have some kind of abbreivation (stands for Audio Drama Database)
                - afraid that isn't "catchy" enough, will pitch to some people and get a general consensus
